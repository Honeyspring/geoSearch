### GEO_SEARCH repository

I'm Oyindamola Ogunsola and here is my app Geo-Search which allows users to search for places and extract information such as the timeZone,map and local weather conditions like temperature,wind speed,humidity and precipitation.


Getting Started
As a user to use geoSearch you load the url on your browser and for testing purpose it has been hosted on github pages and a link is included in the description on the dashboard in the repository.
  As a programmer you just have to clone the repository to your local computer following github instructions,once done you can view and make changes locally,to fix browser compabilities with ES6 syntax and others gulp was used to compile file so to get the pages in thre folder named 'dist ' running ensure you have to run npm install to get node-modules and dependencies.

Prerequisites
Ensure node js is installed on your computer to run npm.


Installing
 run npm install on cmd after navigating to project folder to get node_modules.

Running the tests
once node modules and packages have been installed you can then get the index.html to load correctly on any browser.

Built With
